            Small amounts of fur, which helps to let out heat, whilst still keeping some in for the night, when it gets cold.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            Large ears, which help to disperse the heat, and allow the fennec fox to hear better, allowing it to escape from predators easier.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            A long tail, which helps the fox to turn quickly while moving, as well as acting as insulation during the night, helping the fennec fox stay warm by wrapping its tail around its whole body.
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            Pale fur that acts as camoflage, allowing the fennec fox to blend in to the desert. This allows it to avoid detection from potential predators.
